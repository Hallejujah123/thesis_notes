# Introduction

The software development lifecycle is increasingly dependent on effective metrics to ensure quality and maintainability. Process and product metrics have emerged as pivotal tools in this endeavor, enabling teams to assess efficiency, predict faults, and optimize performance. The thesis, *"Analysis of the Popularity of Process and Product Metrics for Quality Evaluation and Maintenance"*, seeks to explore the factors influencing the widespread adoption of specific metrics and their role in software engineering.

## Background and Relevance

Process and product metrics serve distinct but complementary purposes in software quality assessment. Product metrics, such as **cyclomatic complexity** and **lines of code (LOC)**, quantify software characteristics, aiding in maintainability and fault prediction (Basili et al., 1996). Process metrics, including **defect density trends** and **time-to-repair (TTR)**, evaluate development and maintenance efficiency (Fenton & Pfleeger, 1996). The interplay of these metrics ensures a comprehensive view of software health, making their selection and application critical.

Studies like those by Dijkman et al. (2011) emphasize the importance of **behavioral and structural metrics** in assessing complex systems. These metrics provide insights into process dynamics, reinforcing their relevance in iterative and agile development environments. Similarly, Parida et al. (2015) highlight the role of **performance indicators (PIs)** in maintenance management, where metrics like **mean time between failures (MTBF)** and **mean time to repair (MTTR)** directly impact operational efficiency.

## Emerging Trends and Challenges

Despite their utility, the popularity of metrics is influenced by factors beyond technical merit. Sajnani et al. (2014) explored the relationship between popularity and quality in Maven components, revealing that widespread adoption is often driven by usability and ecosystem support rather than inherent quality. Metrics supported by automation tools and integrated frameworks tend to see higher adoption due to their ease of use.

Another critical aspect is the balance between simplicity and effectiveness. While metrics like **LOC** are easy to measure, they offer limited insight into software complexity compared to more nuanced measures like **Weighted Methods per Class (WMC)**. This trade-off between simplicity and depth often dictates a metric's adoption in real-world scenarios.

## Research Objectives

Building on these insights, this thesis aims to:
1. Analyze the reasons behind the adoption of specific process and product metrics in software engineering.
2. Evaluate the impact of these metrics on quality evaluation and maintenance practices.
3. Identify trends and best practices that influence metric selection in industry and academia.

By integrating empirical findings with theoretical frameworks, this research seeks to contribute to the understanding of metric effectiveness and popularity in software development.

## Structure of the Thesis

The thesis will proceed as follows:
1. A literature review summarizing key contributions and debates surrounding process and product metrics.
2. Methodology for analyzing metric adoption across various domains and projects.
3. Empirical findings on the factors influencing metric popularity.
4. Recommendations for integrating effective metrics into quality evaluation and maintenance strategies.

This work aspires to bridge the gap between academic research and practical application, offering insights into the evolving landscape of software metrics.
