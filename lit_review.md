# Systematic Literature Review: Analysis of the Popularity of Process and Product Metrics for Quality Evaluation and Maintenance

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Software quality evaluation and maintenance have become crucial in modern software engineering, as the complexity of software systems continues to grow. Software metrics provide a structured approach to assessing software quality by offering quantitative measures for various attributes, including maintainability, reliability, and fault-proneness. These metrics are widely used in both academia and industry to aid software engineers in identifying potential weaknesses in code, optimizing development practices, and improving overall software quality.

Understanding the popularity and effectiveness of specific software metrics is essential for organizations striving to enhance their software development lifecycle. Despite the availability of numerous software metrics, only a subset gains widespread adoption due to factors such as ease of use, predictive accuracy, and industry acceptance. Process and product metrics play a vital role in ensuring software maintainability, as they provide insights into the internal structure of a system and help anticipate potential defects before they impact the final product.

This study investigates the adoption and effectiveness of process and product metrics for software quality evaluation and maintenance. By analyzing existing literature, this research aims to identify widely used metrics, assess their empirical validation, and explore the factors contributing to their popularity.

- Identify process and product metrics that are widely utilized in software engineering.
- Assess the empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of these metrics.
- Explore the reasons behind the popularity of specific metrics over others.
- Provide insights into trends in metric adoption across different software development methodologies.

By addressing these objectives, this study seeks to contribute to a better understanding of how software metrics influence development practices and decision-making in software quality management.

### 1.3 Research Questions

To achieve the aforementioned objectives, the following research questions have been formulated:

1. **RQ1**: What process and product metrics are most commonly used for quality evaluation and maintenance?
2. **RQ2**: What empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of these metrics?

### Summary

The selected metrics provide a comprehensive foundation for evaluating software quality from multiple perspectives. Object-oriented metrics help assess design complexity and maintainability, fault prediction metrics enable proactive defect identification, and popularity and quality metrics capture user adoption trends. The empirical support for these metrics highlights their effectiveness in different software engineering contexts, making them valuable tools for researchers and practitioners alike.

The excluded metrics were omitted due to limitations such as lack of automated tooling support, high complexity, or weak empirical correlation with software quality. These exclusions ensure that the selected metrics provide practical and reliable insights into software maintainability, fault prediction and component popularity.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Factors Influencing Metric Adoption
