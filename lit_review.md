# Systematic Literature Review: Analysis of the Popularity of Process and Product Metrics for Quality Evaluation and Maintenance

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Software quality evaluation and maintenance have become crucial in modern software engineering, as the complexity of software systems continues to grow. Software metrics provide a structured approach to assessing software quality by offering quantitative measures for various attributes, including maintainability, reliability, and fault-proneness. These metrics are widely used in both academia and industry to aid software engineers in identifying potential weaknesses in code, optimizing development practices, and improving overall software quality.

Understanding the popularity and effectiveness of specific software metrics is essential for organizations striving to enhance their software development lifecycle. Despite the availability of numerous software metrics, only a subset gains widespread adoption due to factors such as ease of use, predictive accuracy, and industry acceptance. Process and product metrics play a vital role in ensuring software maintainability, as they provide insights into the internal structure of a system and help anticipate potential defects before they impact the final product.

This study investigates the adoption and effectiveness of process and product metrics for software quality evaluation and maintenance. By analyzing existing literature, this research aims to identify widely used metrics, assess their empirical validation, and explore the factors contributing to their popularity.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

The objective of this systematic literature review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of software metrics used for quality evaluation and maintenance. The study aims to:

- Identify process and product metrics that are widely utilized in software engineering.
- Assess the empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of these metrics.
- Explore the reasons behind the popularity of specific metrics over others.
- Provide insights into trends in metric adoption across different software development methodologies.

By addressing these objectives, this study seeks to contribute to a better understanding of how software metrics influence development practices and decision-making in software quality management.

### 1.3 Research Questions

To achieve the aforementioned objectives, the following research questions have been formulated:

1. **RQ1**: What process and product metrics are most commonly used for quality evaluation and maintenance?
2. **RQ2**: What empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of these metrics?
3. **RQ3**: What factors contribute to the popularity of certain software metrics?

These research questions guide the analysis and synthesis of findings from existing literature, providing a structured framework for evaluating software metrics in practice.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Research Design

This study follows the guidelines for conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) as outlined by Kitchenham and Charters (2007). The SLR methodology ensures a rigorous and unbiased approach to collecting, analyzing, and synthesizing existing research related to software metrics for quality evaluation and maintenance.

The research process consists of three main phases:
1. **Planning the Review** – Defining the research questions, identifying search strategies, and establishing inclusion and exclusion criteria.
2. **Conducting the Review** – Searching for relevant studies, selecting articles based on predefined criteria, and extracting key data.
3. **Reporting the Findings** – Analyzing the results, synthesizing key insights, and discussing implications for research and practice.

This structured approach ensures the reliability and validity of the findings presented in this study.

### 2.2 Search Strategy

A comprehensive search was conducted in widely recognized digital libraries and academic databases, including:
- IEEE Xplore
- ACM Digital Library
- Elsevier
- Springer
- Google Scholar

The search terms used to retrieve relevant literature included:
- "software metrics for quality evaluation"
- "fault prediction metrics in software engineering"
- "software maintainability metrics"
- "popularity of software quality metrics"

To refine the search, Boolean operators such as AND and OR were used to combine terms and retrieve the most relevant studies. Additionally, snowballing techniques were applied by reviewing references in selected articles to identify further relevant literature. Articles from high-impact journals and conferences were prioritized to ensure quality and relevance.

## 3. Results and Analysis

The process of selecting relevant software metrics for quality evaluation and maintenance was carried out through a structured methodology. This section details the identification process, the criteria for selection, and a comparative analysis of the chosen and excluded metrics.

### 3.1 Selection Process and Criteria

#### Identification of Metrics
Numerous metrics were identified, and their relevance to quality evaluation and maintenance was assessed. The studies that provided empirical validation of these metrics were prioritized to ensure the selection was backed by real-world data.

#### Criteria for Selection

**Initial Pool**: 127 metrics identified from literature.
To ensure the chosen metrics were relevant, effective, and practical, the following selection criteria were applied:

1. **Empirical Validation** – Metrics had to be supported by research studies demonstrating their effectiveness in assessing software quality.
2. **Predictive Power** – Metrics were chosen based on their ability to predict software maintainability, defect-proneness, or component usability.
3. **Industry Adoption** – Metrics commonly used in industry tools or frameworks were prioritized.
4. **Comprehensiveness** – The selected metrics needed to cover multiple aspects of software quality, including design complexity, fault prediction, and component quality.
5. **Ease of Interpretation** – Metrics that are easier to compute and interpret were favored to ensure practical usability.
6. **Tool Support** – The availability of automated tools for measuring these metrics was considered an essential factor for industry relevance (SonarQube, PMD, etc.).

Using these criteria, three main categories of software metrics were analyzed: Object-Oriented Design Metrics, Fault Prediction Metrics, and Popularity & Quality Metrics in Software Components.
