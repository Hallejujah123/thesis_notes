# Systematic Literature Review: Analysis of the Popularity of Process and Product Metrics for Quality Evaluation and Maintenance

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Software engineering relies on metrics to ensure high-quality development and maintainability. Software metrics provide quantitative insight into the processes and products of software development, aiding in fault prediction and maintainability evaluation. Understanding which metrics gain prominence and why is essential for improving software quality and supporting decision-making in software engineering. This systematic literature review (SLR) investigates the popularity of process and product metrics for quality evaluation and maintenance.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this SLR are:

- To identify widely used process and product metrics in software engineering.
- To analyze the empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of these metrics.
- To understand the factors influencing the popularity of certain metrics over others.

### 1.3 Research Questions

This study aims to answer the following research questions:

1. **RQ1**: What process and product metrics are most commonly used for quality evaluation and maintenance?
2. **RQ2**: What empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of these metrics?
3. **RQ3**: What factors contribute to the popularity of certain software metrics?

## 2. Methodology

### 2.3 Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

The selected studies were evaluated based on:

1. Relevance to software quality evaluation and maintenance.
2. Empirical validation of metrics.
3. Sample size and methodology used in studies.
4. Citation count and impact factor of the journal/conference.

## 3. Results and Analysis

### 3.1 Object-Oriented Design Metrics

#### Key Metrics:

- **Weighted Methods per Class (WMC):** Measures class complexity based on the number of methods.
- **Coupling Between Object Classes (CBO):** Measures dependencies between classes.
- **Lack of Cohesion on Methods (LCOM):** Quantifies relatedness of methods within a class.
- **Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT):** Evaluates the number of inheritance levels in a class hierarchy.
- **Response for a Class (RFC):** Counts the number of methods that can be executed in response to a message received by an object.

#### Insights:

- Studies (Basili et al., 1996; Chidamber & Kemerer, 1994) validate these metrics as strong indicators of fault-proneness and maintainability.
- High WMC and CBO are associated with increased fault likelihood (Gyimothy et al., 2005).
- RFC and LCOM provide actionable insights for improving class cohesion and reducing dependencies (Briand et al., 1999).

### 3.2 Fault Prediction Metrics

#### Key Metrics:

- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Measures the complexity of a program’s control flow.
- **Defect Density:** Tracks the number of defects per unit of code.
- **Code Churn Metrics:** Analyzes changes in code, such as additions, modifications, and deletions.
- **Halstead Metrics:** Assesses program readability and maintainability based on operator and operand usage.

#### Insights:

- Cyclomatic complexity is a widely accepted fault predictor (Catal & Diri, 2009).
- Code churn metrics effectively predict defects in agile development environments (Nagappan & Ball, 2005).
- Halstead metrics offer valuable insights into code readability and maintainability (Rahman et al., 2023).

### 3.3 Popularity and Quality Metrics in Software Components

#### Key Metrics:

- **Defect Density:** Evaluates software reliability.
- **Reusability Metrics:** Measures adaptability of software components for reuse.
- **Component Popularity Metrics:** Includes download counts, ratings, and community engagement.
- **Documentation Quality Metrics:** Assesses the comprehensiveness and clarity of software documentation.

#### Insights:

- Usability and ecosystem support influence component popularity (Sajnani et al., 2014).
- Reusability metrics highlight the benefits of modular design (Mendes et al., 2005).
- Well-documented components are preferred in open-source projects (Baggen et al., 2012).

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Factors Influencing Metric Adoption

- **Ease of Use:** Simple, interpretable metrics (e.g., defect density, cyclomatic complexity) are widely adopted.
- **Predictive Power:** Metrics validated by empirical studies (e.g., WMC, CBO) see higher adoption.
- **Tool Support:** Metrics integrated into automated analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube) gain widespread usage.
- **Industry and Research Trends:** Metrics that align with agile methodologies and DevOps practices are gaining traction.

### 4.2 Challenges

- **Metric Overload:** The abundance of metrics makes selection difficult.
- **Context Dependence:** Metrics validated in one domain may not generalize to another.
- **Complexity vs. Adoption:** Advanced metrics require more effort to implement and interpret.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work

This SLR provides a comprehensive overview of the most popular process and product metrics for quality evaluation and maintenance in software engineering. The findings indicate that object-oriented design metrics, fault prediction metrics, and software component quality metrics play a critical role in evaluating software quality. The study also highlights the importance of tool support and empirical validation in driving metric adoption.

Future work should focus on:

- Investigating the impact of machine learning-based metrics in software quality prediction.
- Conducting longitudinal studies to analyze the evolving trends in metric adoption.
- Developing unified frameworks that integrate multiple metric categories for a holistic evaluation approach.
