# Systematic Literature Review: Analysis of the Popularity of Process and Product Metrics for Quality Evaluation and Maintenance

## Introduction

Software engineering relies heavily on metrics to ensure high-quality development and maintainability. Metrics allow developers and organizations to quantitatively assess processes and products, aiding in fault prediction and maintainability evaluation. This review synthesizes insights from 27 articles that focus on Object-Oriented Design Metrics, Fault Prediction Metrics and Popularity and Quality Metrics in Software Components. The aim is to understand why certain metrics gain prominence, their effectiveness and their practical implications.

## Key Themes and Metrics

### 1. Object-Oriented Design Metrics

#### Metrics Discussed:
- **Weighted Methods per Class (WMC):** Measures class complexity by counting methods. Higher WMC can indicate testing challenges and increased fault-proneness.  
- **Coupling Between Object Classes (CBO):** Indicates the degree of dependency between classes. High CBO suggests tight coupling, increasing the risk of cascading failures.  
- **Lack of Cohesion on Methods (LCOM):** Quantifies how closely methods in a class are related. Lower cohesion indicates poor design, which can complicate maintenance.  
- **Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT):** Evaluates inheritance levels. Deep inheritance trees can lead to increased complexity and difficulty in understanding code behavior.  
- **Response for a Class (RFC):** Counts the number of methods invoked in response to a message, reflecting complexity and testing effort.  

#### Insights:
- Studies (Basili et al., 1996; Chidamber & Kemerer, 1994) empirically validate these metrics as strong predictors of fault-proneness.  
- Metrics like CBO and LCOM are particularly effective in identifying maintainability risks during the design phase (Gyimothy et al., 2005; Briand et al., 1999).  
- These metrics are foundational and widely used because of their simplicity, practicality, and ability to offer actionable insights early in the development lifecycle.

#### Trends:
- Recent studies (El Emam et al., 2001) emphasize the role of object-oriented metrics in large-scale systems, where they help prioritize testing efforts.  
- Metrics such as RFC and WMC are increasingly used alongside automated tools for real-time quality monitoring.

### 2. Fault Prediction Metrics

#### Metrics Discussed:
- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** A structural metric that measures the complexity of code by counting independent control paths. High values suggest higher testing requirements and error likelihood.  
- **Defect Density:** Tracks the number of defects per unit of code (e.g., lines of code or function points), offering a straightforward measure of quality.  
- **Code Churn Metrics:** Monitors changes in code, such as added, modified, or deleted lines, which often correlate with fault-proneness.  
- **Halstead Metrics:** Focus on program readability, maintainability, and understandability using operator and operand counts.  
- **Class Size Metrics:** Examine the size of a class in terms of lines or methods. Larger classes are often harder to maintain and more prone to errors.  

#### Insights:
- Cyclomatic complexity is widely recognized for its predictive power in identifying high-risk modules (Catal & Diri, 2009; Nagappan & Ball, 2005).  
- Defect density is a simple yet effective indicator of software reliability and is extensively used in both research and industry (Menzies et al., 2007).  
- Studies (Ostrand et al., 2005; Arisholm et al., 2010) reveal that code churn metrics are particularly valuable in agile environments, where frequent changes can destabilize codebases.  
- Halstead metrics complement structural metrics by providing insights into code readability, which directly affects maintainability (Rahman et al., 2023).  

#### Trends:
- Machine learning models are increasingly applied to integrate and enhance the predictive capabilities of traditional metrics (Lomio et al., 2021).  
- Code churn metrics are gaining traction as they capture dynamic codebase changes that static metrics often miss.

### 3. Popularity and Quality Metrics in Software Components

#### Metrics Discussed:
- **Defect Density:** Tracks fault-proneness in software components.  
- **Reusability Metrics:** Measures the adaptability of a component for reuse in different contexts, which can reduce development costs.  
- **Component Popularity Metrics:** Includes measures such as download counts, ratings, and community support to assess a component's practical relevance.  
- **Documentation Quality Metrics:** Evaluates the comprehensiveness and clarity of component documentation, which significantly impacts usability.  

#### Insights:
- Sajnani et al. (2014) found that usability and ecosystem support often outweigh intrinsic quality in determining component adoption.  
- Reusability metrics (Mendes et al., 2005; Krishna & Bhatia, 2022) highlight the importance of modular and adaptable designs, which simplify integration and testing.  
- Documentation quality significantly impacts the perceived reliability of components, particularly in open-source ecosystems (Baggen et al., 2012).  

#### Trends:
- Automated tools like SonarQube increasingly include reusability and documentation quality checks, encouraging adoption.  
- Studies emphasize the growing importance of balancing simplicity and depth in metrics to maximize usability without sacrificing actionable insights.

## Analysis

### Factors Influencing Metric Adoption
1. **Practicality and Ease of Use:** Simple metrics like defect density and cyclomatic complexity are popular because they are easy to compute and interpret.  
2. **Predictive Power:** Metrics with strong empirical validation, such as WMC and code churn, are widely adopted because of their reliability in identifying high-risk areas.  
3. **Tool Support:** Metrics integrated into automated tools (e.g., SonarQube, static analysis platforms) see higher adoption due to ease of implementation and real-time feedback.  
4. **Relevance to Context:** Metrics that address specific needs, such as reusability in component-based development or churn in agile projects, gain traction in their respective domains.

### Challenges
1. **Overload of Metrics:** With an abundance of available metrics, selecting the right ones for a project can be overwhelming.  
2. **Generalization Issues:** Metrics validated in one domain may not generalize well to others, limiting their broader applicability.  
3. **Complexity of Implementation:** Metrics requiring advanced computation or deep learning models face barriers to adoption despite their accuracy.

## Conclusion

This review highlights the significance of software metrics in fault prediction and maintainability. Metrics such as WMC, cyclomatic complexity, and defect density are consistently validated as effective tools for assessing software quality. Their popularity is influenced by practicality, predictive power, and ease of integration with tools. Emerging trends, such as machine learning-enhanced metrics and automated tool support, suggest a promising direction for future research and development.

By understanding these metrics and their applications, this review contributes to the ongoing effort to optimize software quality evaluation and maintenance strategies.
