# Literature Review: Analysis of the Popularity of Process and Product Metrics for Quality Evaluation and Maintenance (short draft)

## Overview
This literature review synthesizes insights from selected academic works focusing on process and product metrics in software engineering. The articles were chosen based on their relevance to the topic, breadth of covered metrics, and empirical validation of findings. Each metric discussed was selected due to its demonstrated impact on software quality, maintainability, or process optimization.

## Key Articles and Insights

### 1. **Object-Oriented Design Metrics**
- **Why This Article and Metrics:**  
  Basili et al. (1996) empirically validate object-oriented metrics like WMC, CBO, and LCOM as predictors of fault-prone classes. These metrics were chosen for their relevance in identifying maintainability challenges early in the development lifecycle, making them critical to understanding metric popularity. (add here some graph in full version)

- **Metrics Discussed:**  
  - Weighted Methods per Class (WMC)  
  - Coupling Between Object Classes (CBO)  
  - Lack of Cohesion on Methods (LCOM)  

- **Insights:**  
  These metrics highlight software design complexities and dependencies, enabling developers to address potential issues proactively. Their ease of application during the design phase contributes to their widespread adoption.

### 2. **Business Process Model Metrics**
- **Why This Article and Metrics:**  
  Dijkman et al. (2011) focus on metrics tailored for process models, such as structural and behavioral similarity, which align closely with the thesis theme of evaluating process-oriented metrics. (metrics for business, but IT is business too)

- **Metrics Discussed:**  
  - Node Matching Similarity  
  - Structural Similarity  
  - Behavioral Similarity  

- **Insights:**  
  These metrics excel in optimizing and evaluating complex processes. Their ability to address dependencies and behavior within workflows makes them highly relevant for process-driven industries.

### 3. **Maintenance Performance Metrics**
- **Why This Article and Metrics:**  
  Parida et al. (2015) review maintenance performance systems, emphasizing metrics like MTBF and MTTR. These metrics are widely adopted in asset-intensive industries, making them crucial for understanding metric popularity in maintenance contexts.

- **Metrics Discussed:**  
  - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)  
  - Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)  
  - Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)  

- **Insights:**  
  These metrics measure efficiency, reliability, and the economic impact of maintenance activities. Their integration into performance management systems enhances their practical utility.

### 4. **Popularity and Quality in Software Components**
- **Why This Article and Metrics:**  
  Sajnani et al. (2014) explore the link between quality and popularity in software components, offering a perspective on how usability and ecosystem support drive metric adoption.

- **Metrics Discussed:**  
  - Defect Density  
  - Usability Metrics  

- **Insights:**  
  Metrics like defect density remain popular due to their simplicity and clear link to software quality. Usability-focused metrics gain traction because they resonate with developer needs and are often supported by tooling.

### 5. **Performance Measurement Frameworks**
- **Why This Article and Metrics:**  
  Parida and colleagues examine multi-criteria performance frameworks, which balance financial and non-financial indicators. This aligns with the thesis focus on integrating diverse metrics for holistic evaluation.

- **Metrics Discussed:**  
  - Financial and Non-Financial Indicators  
  - Balanced Scorecard Metrics  

- **Insights:**  
  These frameworks ensure that metrics address both strategic and operational goals, highlighting the importance of a balanced approach in achieving sustainable quality management.
